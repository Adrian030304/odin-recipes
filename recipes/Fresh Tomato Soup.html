        <li>4 cups chopped fresh tomatoes</li>
        <li>2 cups chicken broth</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic</li>
        <li>1 large slice of onion</li>

      <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>
          Combine tomatoes, chicken broth, garlic cloves, and a large slice of
          onion in a stockpot over medium heat. Bring to a boil, and gently
          simmer for about 20 minutes to blend flavors.
        </li>
        <li>
          Remove from heat and run the mixture through a food mill into a large
          bowl, or pan. Discard any stuff left over in the food mill.
        </li>
        <li>
          Melt butter over medium heat in the now empty stockpot. Stir in flour
          to make a roux by cooking, whisking constantly, until mixture turns
          medium brown.
        </li>
        <li>
          Gradually whisk in a bit of the tomato mixture to prevent lumps from
          forming, then stir in the rest.
        </li>
        <li>Season with sugar and salt to taste.</li>
        <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
      </ol>
